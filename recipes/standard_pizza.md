# Standard pizza recipe

Source: [The Pizza Bible](https://tonyspizzanapoletana.com/the-pizza-bible/)

This is almost entirely based on the basic pizza dough recipe from Tony Gemignani. It's a really solid recipe to get started with pizza dough at home. Please note that this recipe requires **2 days cold fermentation**, plan around that!

## Ingredients

**For 3 pizzas**

- 453g flour: the type of flour can really influence the results of the dough making process. I strongly recommend using specific pizza flour (note: lots of shops sell "pizza flour" which is basically flour with yeast, you don't want that). Look for flours with around 12 to 14% protein; below is a list of [recommended flour brands](#recommended-flours), some of them can be found in shops or online.

- 4.5g active dry yeast (baker's yeast)

- 9g brown sugar (gives the dough a nicer color). Diastatic malt is even better.

- 9g salt

- 5g olive oil

- 200g ice water: the original recipe uses 225g of cold water, but in my repeated experience it's really too much, at least with the flours I've been using. The more water you can use the better, but the dough becomes stickier and harder to work with. This water should be as cold as possible to delay the fermentation process.

- 70g lukewarm water: this water will be used to wake up the yeast (it still goes in the dough)

## Material

- This dough can be made by hand or with a mixer (instructions will be given for making the dough by hand)

- Baking paper and plastic film

- Nice to have: a pizza stone (recommended), but you can just use your oven's baking tray (not the rack!)

- Nice to have: three small boxes for individual fermentation (*e.g.* circular boxes around 20-25cm diameter)

- Nice to have: a dough cutter to handle the dough

## Instructions

### Day 1

- Activate the yeast: place the yeast in a bowl and add the lukewarm water. Use a small whisk or a spoon to mix until the yeast is entirely dissolved (there should be no clump). If there is absolutely no foam and / or you see yeast floating, your yeast may be dead, and you should restart with a new batch.

- Add the sugar (or malt) to the flour and mix to combine.

- Add the cold water to the flour, reserve a little bit of cold water to wash the yeast bowl later.

- Stir flour and water together a bit and add the yeast + lukewarm water mixture. Rince the yeast bowl with the remaining cold water to get all the yeast.

- Start working the dough with your hands, pull the dough from the side of the bowl to the center, press down, then rotate. If the dough is too dry (*i.e.* flour does not incorporate well or the dough does not stick together well), add a tiny bit of water (do that really progressively). If the dough is too wet (really sticky, you can't work it), add flour little by little. Give the dough some time before adjusting water / flour, see if you can work it as it is. It should be a little bit sticky but still stay together.

- After 1 minute of working, add the salt and keep mixing until incorporated.

- Make a well in the center of the dough and add the oil, mix until combined.

- Knead the dough for 2-3 minutes; if you have a clean flat stone surface, use it. If not, try to knead the dough inside the bowl. To knead the dough, press it down away from you, turn it 45 degrees, gather it and reshape it into a ball. Repeat this movement for 2-3 minutes; the dough should be pretty smooth at this point. Careful not to over-knead the dough, it will become too elastic!

- Cover the dough with a wet towel for 1h to rest at room temperature.

- Transfer the dough into a bowl, sprinkle a few drops of water on the surface of the dough, cover with plastic wrap (the bowl should be sealed), and put in the fridge for **24h**.

### Day 2

- The next day, take the dough out and gently knead it for 30s to remove the gas bubbles.

- Shape the dough into a ball and split it in three equal-size parts (use a scale to make sure the three dough balls are of similar weight).

- "Ball" each of the individual dough balls: hold the edges of the dough between your hands and fold back the left and right sides to the center of the dough (on the bottom side). This process should create a smooth "skin" on the surface of the ball, try to keep this skin intact as you stretch the dough. Turn the dough 45 degrees and repeat the process. Do that several times until the ball has a really smooth surface, and then pinch the bottom of the dough to "seal" it.

- Place each of the three balls into a sealed box and put them in the fridge. If you do not have boxes, you can place the three balls on a flat surface (*e.g.* a plastic cutting board or a baking sheet) and cover with plastic wrap (it should be sealed).

### Day 3

- Take the dough out and let it rest at room temperature for 1-2h.

- Meanwhile, start pre-heating your oven as hot as possible, with the pizza stone / tray inside.

- Flour a flat surface (if you have semolina, use a flour + semolina mix)

- Transfer a dough ball to the surface. At this stage, it's important to not "break" the dough to keep the gas inside and preserve the gluten network. However, if you see big gas bubbles, pinch them. Put your hands around 2cm from the edge of the dough circle and start pressing down to create the external rim. Then, start stretching the dough; try to place your hands away from the center while stretching, as the center will stretch itself anyway and you don't want to make it too thin. Keep stretching the dough until it reaches ~ 30 - 35 cm diameter.

- Add sauce, cheese, and other ingredients. Be as fast as you can so the dough doesn't get soggy.

- Move the pizza to a flat surface (pizza peel or cutting board) and transfer it to the oven.

- Cook until the edge of the crust starts browning

## Tips

### Avoid burnt cheese

- In a home oven, often the cheese will be cooked before the dough. To avoid ending up with burnt cheese, you can cut the mozzarella ball into big chunks, dry the chunks as much as possible, and place them in the freezer to have them really cold before baking the pizza. You can also cook the crust + sauce first and add cheese after a while.

### Recommended flours

- Le 5 Stagioni

- Antimo Caputo 00 Flour

- Molino San Felice 00

- Molino Pasini

### Cheese

You should really be using mozzarella as your base cheese, preferably Fior di Latte or Mozzarella di Buffala Campana.

### Sauce

Go with whatever you like. Real pizza sauce is made of uncooked crushed tomatoes and that's it, but it won't taste good unless you have very good tomatoes (*e.g.* good san marzano tomatoes). Try to find the best tomatoes you can get, even canned is ok. Some recommended brands: Strianese, Nina, La Regina di San Marzano.

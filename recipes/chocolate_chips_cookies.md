There is a lot of info in there that I haven't really got time to dig into. I followed the recipe and got some decent cookies on the first try.

## Ingredients

**For 24 cookies**

- 225g soften butter (**not melted!**)
- 75g white granulated sugar
- 75g brown granulated sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 375g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 0.5 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 pack of good baking chocolate

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 190C. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

- Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt (**don't add the sugar!!**).

- Use a whisk to cream butter and both white and brown sugar together.

- Add in the eggs and vanilla extract to the butter and sugar mixture and whisk until fluffy.

- Mix in the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda / powder, and salt) and mix until well combined.

- Cut the chocolate into small bits and mix them in the batter.

- Roll little balls of dough (1 big table spoon) and place them onto the parchment paper.

- Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until they barely start turning brown.

- Let the cookies sit on the baking tray for 2 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack.

# Fluffy pancakes

Source: https://cafedelites.com/best-fluffy-pancakes/

## Ingredients

**For 12 pancakes** (good for 4 not too hungry people)

- 250g flour
- 50g sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4th teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 350mL milk
- 60g butter (melted)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 egg

## Instructions

- Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.

- Make a pit and add the milk, melted butter, vanilla extract, and egg.

- Start incorporating the dry ingredients in the wet mixtures little by little.

- Mix until you get a homogeneous mix. The batter should be pretty thick but still liquid enough to fall from the spoon into the pan; adjust texture with milk if necessary.

- Heat up a pan on medium-high heat (not too high or the pancakes will burn).

- Drop a ladle of batter in the pan (no need to butter the pan if it's a good pan), let it spread into a circle (give a little help if necessary). Wait for bubbles to form on the upper side (should take around 1 minute) and flip the pancake with a spatula. Cook the other side for about 30 seconds before taking off the pan.


## Misc

- This recipe makes nice fluffy pancakes; I've tried it and it worked very well.

- Doubling the quantities was enough for 6 hungover people.
